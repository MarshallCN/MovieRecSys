# Recommendation System Notebooks

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks related to different recommendation system techniques, including deep learning, collaborative filtering, hashing techniques, and clustering approaches.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. DLRecSys.ipynb
- Focuses on **Matrix Factorization (MF)** techniques.
- Uses embedding-based representation of users and items.
- Includes references to Keras implementations.

### 2. MovieReviewRecSys_New.ipynb
- Focuses on **data processing** for recommendation systems using movie reviews and tags.
- Prepares the dataset for training and evaluation.
- Contains over 400 code cells handling data transformations and feature engineering.

### 3. BasicRecSys.ipynb
- Implements basic collaborative filtering (CF) techniques.
- Includes **user similarity computation** to find similar users.
- Provides foundational approaches to personalized recommendations.

### 4. ClusterGraph.ipynb
- Applies **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to recommendation data.
- Deals with time-series data and clustering for feature reduction.
- Helps in visualizing high-dimensional recommendation data.

### 5. HashTest.ipynb
- Uses **hashing techniques and PCA** for recommendation tasks.
- Explores dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Useful for scalable and efficient similarity searches.

### 6. TagRecSys_CF.ipynb
- Implements **tag-based collaborative filtering**.
- Processes datasets to improve recommendations using tags.
- Explores dataset splitting and CF methods.

## Usage
These notebooks are designed for research and experimentation in recommendation systems. You can run them in a Jupyter Notebook environment after installing the necessary dependencies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn, SciPy
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning-based models)

## Acknowledgments
Some methodologies reference external sources for implementation, such as Keras tutorials and research papers.
